This file is for describing the requirements for each framework in a JSON file.

General Requirements: 

For swipes: ATM there is not enough information to replicate a swipe with any accuracy. In order to accurately replicate a swipe,
the command must measure start location, end location, and duration, or else start, direction, and distance.

For Android-Generated icons: When the phone generates things like toolbars at the top of the screen, those objects are not
distinguished in a way we can recognize in the JSON files. For example, in mileage_swipe.txt, the index, name, etc. of the second
click is for a very vague button. We can only tell that it is the third button up top because of the pixel location, which will vary
by device.
Possible solutions: Record more of the hierarchy in JSON files (computationally complex). Or, tell us if you are using the same device
(pixels can be accurately used for location then).
