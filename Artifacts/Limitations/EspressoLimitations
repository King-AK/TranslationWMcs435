Espresso Limitations

Espresso does not work when there are multiple views with identical data. This data is the data grabbed from UiAutomatorViewer and is 
used to differentiate different views from each other. The problem is that often, especially when there are views that are generated 
by the Android system, like increment buttons for date pickers, buttons with similar functionality have the same data, so Espresso 
cannot tell which view it should interact with.

Espresso's withContentDescription does not seem to work. Using it in the Mileage app did not work when trying to click by content 
description.

JSON file does not contain enough information:
	-scollTo() only works on ScrollView, so when a view is not visible and needs to be scrolled to, there is no way to 
	know if that item is off screen or in a ScrollView so scrollTo() cannot be used otherwise the program breaks. In popup 
	listviews, onData() automatically scrolls to the item if it is not in view.
