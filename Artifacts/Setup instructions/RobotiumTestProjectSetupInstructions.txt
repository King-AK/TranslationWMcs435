2) Fill all the following fields to create the test project:

	- Test Project Name: ExampleApplicationTesting
	- Test Target: Click on "This Project"
	- Build Target: If the application was developed using SDK version 7 then select Android 2.1 - update 1. If it was developed by SDK version 8 then select Android 2.2
	- Properties: Application name: ApplicationTesting
	- Package name: com.Example.ApplicationTesting
	- Min SDK version: Default value will be there according to Build Target selection.
	- Then click finish

3) In "AnroidManifest.xml":
